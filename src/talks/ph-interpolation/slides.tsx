// ============================================================================
// Pythagorean–Hodograph Curves and Their Rational Frames
//   Solution structure, selection, and interactive motion
//
// An interactive monograph for readers who already know PH curves. It does NOT
// introduce arc length, speed, or the hodograph — the audience teaches those.
// It refreshes what is DIFFICULT and how it was resolved, with figures that show
// BEHAVIOUR (a family swept, a landscape, a gap closing, a count jumping) rather
// than definitions, since an instance is what a paper already prints better.
//
// The spine is one framework: prescribe functionals, then count them against the
// manifold's dimension.
//
//   fewer than dim  →  a positive-dimensional fiber  →  need a CHOICE RULE
//                      (minimum-norm transport, null-space projection)
//   exactly dim     →  finitely many solutions       →  BRANCHES, and monodromy
//                      around the discriminant
//   more than dim   →  generically empty             →  a SHAPE obstruction
//
// Interpolation and interactive editing are the same operation in this picture —
// they differ only in WHICH functionals you prescribe (boundary data vs control
// points). The literature populated the middle row; the top row (the choice rule)
// and the loop structure of the middle row are what this deck adds.
//
// Conventions:
//   * one gesture, one lesson, one number per figure — no configuration UI
//     (the research bench lives at /lab/ph-interpolation instead)
//   * a bare NOTATION strip in place of prose, to trigger a concept in half a
//     second without explaining it
//   * each difficulty names the result that resolved it
//   * 2D where the picture is COMPLETE (a plane region is fully visible);
//     3D where the phenomenon is genuinely 3D (gauge, frames, torsion, families)

    notes:
      'Both objects have 6 real DOF (quadratic Bézier: 3 planar control points; planar PH cubic: ' +
      'the linear generator w₀,w₁ = 4 real, plus the integration constant = 2). Three interpolation ' +
      'points impose 6 real conditions. Both square. The quadratic\'s equations are LINEAR, so one ' +
      'solution; the PH cubic\'s are QUADRATIC, so two. That is the whole price of PH, and it needs ' +
      'no introduction to state. ' +
      'Mechanism: c(t)−c(0) = A(t)w₀² + B(t)w₀w₁ + C(t)w₁² with A,B,C REAL, so w₁ = r·w₀ factors out ' +
      'w₀² and the system collapses to one complex quadratic in r — hence exactly two roots, and the ' +
      'gauge w → −w leaves both q and r fixed so it does not merge them. Verified in phCubic.test.ts ' +
      'across many data sets and t₁ values. Both panels are closed form; no optimizer.',

    notes:
      'On the PH variety, "move one control point and freeze the others" is not a motion at all — it ' +
      'leaves the variety. Codimension, not solver weakness, and worth hitting deliberately here ' +
      'rather than letting someone discover it later as a bug. ' +
      'Pin P₀,P₃: 6 DOF − 4 conditions = 2, exactly one point of freedom (forced, not chosen). So P₁ ' +
      'is free and P₂ follows, via r² + r + (1 − D/q) = 0 — two branches. ' +
      'Orange segment (P₃ → P₀+(4/3)D): the only placements of P₁ where EVERY branch is cusped, so ' +
      'existence is unrestricted while regularity is not. Off the chord line no branch is cusped at ' +
      'all, since a cusp needs r real. Purple circle: the branch point P₀+(4/3)D, where the roots ' +
      'merge at r = −1/2 doubly. ' +
      '"run loop" is the monodromy demonstration — P₁ goes once around the branch point and returns ' +
      'to exactly where it started, following the nearest root at each step (which is what a drag ' +
      'does), and P₂ lands on the OTHER solution. The branch structure is a two-sheeted cover of the ' +
      'P₁-plane branched at a single point: the simplest nontrivial monodromy there is, on a PH curve. ' +
      'Verified in phCubic.test.ts, including that a loop NOT enclosing the point returns unchanged. ' +
      'Note for the free/strict toggle discussion: there is nothing here for an optimizer to choose. ' +
      'The system is SQUARE, so the only freedom is which branch; minimum-norm transport has room to ' +
      'act only where there is spare freedom, and in the plane with both ends pinned there is none.',
