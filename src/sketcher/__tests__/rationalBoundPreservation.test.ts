/**
 * Production bound-preservation guard for the RATIONAL curve type.
 *
 * The sketcher's optimizeCurve dispatches to per-curve-type solvers; only
 * `kind:'bspline'` had a bound/feel test (editingFeel, openSlideMigration). The
 * rich curve types — the whole reason the production optimizer exists — shipped
 * unguarded: a Jacobian-sign or active-set bug in the rational solver would let
 * the curvature-extrema bound (S⁻, the sign-change count of the g numerator)
 * GROW under a drag, silently. This locks that it cannot.
 *
 * Metric: the constraint state's exact `signs` (g > 0 ? -1 : 1) — what the
 * curvature bar shows the user — fed the homogeneous cps (x·w, y·w, w), exactly
 * as BottomPanel computes them.
 *
 * Teeth: the same quick drag done NAIVELY (snap the control point straight to the
 * cursor, no optimization) DOES raise the bound on these pushes; the optimizer
 * must not. The test asserts both — so it can't pass vacuously.
