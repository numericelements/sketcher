/**
 * "Feel guard" — the open B-spline curvature drag must FEEL good, not just be
 * fast and correct. "Feel" isn't one number; it's a vector of interaction
 * invariants that, together, make the curve deform freely, continuously and
 * predictably under a finger. This locks the deterministic ones so a future
 * change (e.g. re-introducing a hard clamp like core slideCurve's bisect-back
 * guard, which made the point "stuck") fails here:
 *
 *   - TRACKING   — on a reachable drag the dragged point reaches the cursor
 *                  (full freedom; not held back / stuck). This is exactly what
 *                  regressed when the open drag ran on core slideCurve.
 *   - CONTINUITY — each frame's control-point change is proportional to the
 *                  cursor step; no jumps/snaps (smooth deformation).
 *   - REVERSIBILITY — a reachable out-and-back returns near the start (low
 *                  hysteresis) when the bound isn't engaged.
 *   - STABILITY  — never NaN/blows up.
 *
 * Drags run frame-by-frame (RAF-style), the way a finger actually moves, on the
 * shipping path: core slide('polynomial', trust-region) — the EXACT recipe the
 * store routes (the legacy optimizeCurve this test originally guarded was
 * deleted 2026-07-04; the invariants outlived the engine). We do NOT assert
 * subjective taste (coordinated vs point-chases-cursor) — only the absence of
 * the bad feels.
